# Python Nmap Tool

This repository contains a Python-based network scanning tool inspired by Nmap. It utilizes the socket library to check for open ports on a specified IP range. This tool is designed for educational purposes to understand basic network scanning principles.

## Features

- Scan a range of ports on a given IP address.
- Identify open ports using Python's built-in socket library.
- Simple and easy to understand Python code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

## Usage

To use this tool, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
python3 scanner.py [IP address] [start port] [end port]
```

Replace `[IP address]`, `[start port]`, and `[end port]` with your target IP address and port range.
